Once the participant has made a choice, all bandit except the selected one disappear, and only the selected one stays on the screen for 400 miliseconds (0.4 seconds). Then, the reward is displayed: Participants can win between 1-100 points on each trial, depending on which bandit they choose. The reward stays on the screen for 800 miliseconds, then a fixation cross appears in the center of the screen for half a second. After the fixation cross, participants enter the next trial, which is structured in the same way."

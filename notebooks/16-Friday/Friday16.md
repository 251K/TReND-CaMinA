## Teaching topics

Neural codes, spiking networks and plasticity
- Hopfield networks
- Neural codes (spatial behavior and representations: “single neuron” representations, place cells, grid cells)
- Plasticity rules and spiking networks (sRNNs)


## Python specific libraries and dependencies
- numpy, matplotlib, ipywidgets, tqdm, wget
- RatInABox, pandas
